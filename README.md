# HOW TO
\
Download **ALL** the files from the Gdrive. Place ALL of the files into epoch_live/Data. Make sure the file names are the same as the ones in the Google drive when you put them in the folder or they will not be read. (Sometimes Google adds some numbers to the end of the files when you download)

# DOWNLOAD EXCEEDED - HELP!
\
How to bypass the Google Drive download limit: \
Step 1: Create a folder with any name e.g. gd-bypass in your personal Google Drive account.\
Step 2: Open the epochHD link, right click on the archive, Organize -> Add shortcut and select the folder that you created earlier.\
Step 3: Go back to “My Drive”, right click on your folder, Download.

# KNOWN ISSUES:
\
40 skins currently unaccounted for (my tools aren't telling me anything has failed to build) and I'm too slack to look for them now. You can tell me when you find one that's missing\
The AddOn LFG works but the buttons are all covered due to patch-K.MPQ - dunno... fork it and rewrite the interface for if pretty patch is installed is on the cards.\
