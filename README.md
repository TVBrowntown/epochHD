# HOW TO
\
Download **all** the files from the Gdrive. Place ALL of the files into epoch_live/Data.

# KNOWN ISSUES:
\
40 skins currently unaccounted for (my tools aren't telling me anything has failed to build) and I'm too slack to look for them now. You can tell me when you find one that's missing\
The AddOn LFG works but the buttons are all covered due to patch-K.MPQ - dunno... fork it and rewrite the interface for if pretty patch is installed is on the cards.\
